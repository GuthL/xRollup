# Notes

Deployment means doing a git pull on mediumohio first, then an npm run build
(this pushes it to stage)
to deploy to production run ./deploy.sh from the mediumohio box

to deploy the contract, make sure clevis.json is pointed at dai.poa.network on mediumohio
clevis test publish looks like it fails but I think the address publishes for Links contract
then deploy to prod (which does a build)

the relay lives on cryptogs
that means you need to sftp the abi and address over to the src/contracts folder on cryptogs for the relayer to work
then pm2 restart xdairelay.js
